# cpplint.cfg: A basic configuration file for cpplint

# Enable/disable specific checks
# All checks are enabled by default, but you can disable some here if needed.

# Some common checks you might want to configure
# For example, this disables checks for long lines (over 80 characters)
# Disable the check for lines longer than 80 characters
# (If you prefer a larger limit, change it here)
# max_line_length=120

# Disable checking for file includes order
# include_order=false

# Allow or disallow certain naming conventions
# These rules can be adapted based on your project's preferences.
# For example, this sets up some naming conventions:
# snake_case for function names
# camelCase for class names
# Keep these at a default level or change based on the convention you use.

# For example:
# function naming should be in snake_case
function_style=snake_case

# Enable or disable checks for spaces around operators
# (This is just an example; modify as needed)
spaces_around_operator=true

# Check for missing include guards
# Include guards are crucial in header files to prevent multiple inclusion
# from leading to issues.
check_include_guard=true

# Indentation configuration
# Defines the number of spaces for indentation
indent_width=2  # Indentation level (default is 2 spaces)

# Other checks related to file and project structure
file_header=true  # Enforces a file header on all files (can disable if not needed)

# Check for missing documentation on functions and classes
documentation_for_functions=true
documentation_for_classes=true

# Set the file extension types
file_types=cpp,hpp

# You can define what files to check with cpplint
# By default, cpplint checks all *.cpp and *.h files
# file_types=cpp,hpp,cc,hh
